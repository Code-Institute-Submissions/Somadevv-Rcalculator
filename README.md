# Rcalculator

Rcalculator is a tool created to help users easily calculate their mining power based on the NFT crypto project [RPLANET](https://rplanet.io)

Before this was created, there was no easy way to calculate your earnings per day/week/month, so I created this handy tool to do all of the work for you!

# User Experience Design (UX)

## The Strategy Plane

The world of NFTs (Non fungible tokens) are increasingly becoming more and more popular by the day, they're the hottest topic in the crypto world right now! As a follower of the [RPLANET](https://rplanet.io) project, I found it very tedious to have to manually calculate my earnings, that's where **Rcalculator** comes in.

**Rcalculator** was created for [RPLANET](https://rplanet.io) users. The aim is to provide users with an easy to use tool that will calculate and display how much their **AEHTER** per hour is earning them and convert it into other currencies such as **WAX** & **USDT**.

## Site goals
* Give users an easy to use calculation tool for their **AETHER** mining power
* Help users keep track of their crypto earnings
* Help users easily see the price of elements in other currency formats

## User stories
* As a user, I want the main purpose of the site to be clear so that I immediately know what the is intended for upon entering.
* As a user, I want the website to be responsive so that I can use other devices and have no issues
* As a user I want to be able to navigate around the website with ease so that I can view content/manipulate content
* As a user I want to be able to search and filter elements 
* As a user I want to be able to see a live price feed of the currencies

# The Surface Plane
## Design

#### **Colour Scheme**
The main background colour is a gradient of the following colours (HEX) **#38393d**, **#252736**, **#333336**

The main website text is cream

All custom heading text is a deep shade of red #861142

#### **Typography**
The main title/headings on this web application use a custom google font called 'Righteous' font while the rest of the websites content uses the 'Roboto' font.

#### **Imagery**
The **AEHTER** image was taken from [RPLANET](https://rplanet.io)

The **WAX** & **USDT** images were taken from [Google](https://google.co.uk)

The custom tool icons for the mining power & elements were made by my graphics designer **'GNARLY'**

# Features

### **Currencies**

| :---: |  :---:  |  :---: |
| **AETHER** | **WAX** | **USDT** |

#### **There are three currencies used within this website:**
* **AETHER**
    * This is a game currency created by the developers at [RPLANET](https://rplanet.io), you can see a live price feed of this currency over at [Alcor](https://wax.alcor.exchange/trade/aether-e.rplanet_wax-eosio.token)
* **WAX** 
    * WAX (WAXP) is a purpose-built blockchain that is designed to make e-commerce transactions faster, simpler and safer for every party involved. You can see a live price feed of this currency over at [Coingekko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/wax)
* **USDT** 
    * USDT is a stablecoin (stable-value cryptocurrency) that mirrors the price of the U.S. dollar, issued by a Hong Kong-based company Tether. The tokenâ€™s peg to the USD is achieved via maintaining a sum of dollars in reserves that is equal to the number of USDT in circulation. You can see a live price feed of this currency over at [Coingekko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tether)

## Tools & Live prices
* **Live price feed**
    * A live price feed of both currencies used in throughout the web application, this displays both the **AEHTER** & **WAX** live prices updated every 10 seconds. The live price of Aether is taken from [Alcor Exchange](https://wax.alcor.exchange/trade/aether-e.rplanet_wax-eosio.token) using the [Alcor API](https://docs.alcor.exchange/developers-api). The live price of Wax is taken from the [Coingekko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/wax) using the [Coingekko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api#explore-api)

* **Tool selection**
    * A feature to allow users to easily change from the mining power calculator tool, to the elements tool
    <img src="assets/images/readme/toolselector.png" alt="mining power" width="200" height="100"/>


* **Mining tool**
    * A feature to allow users to calculate their **AETHER, WAX, USD** earnings which follows an algorithm based on the live prices
    <img src="assets/images/readme/miningpower_result.png" alt="mining power" width="500" height="175"/>



* **Elements tool**
    * A feature to allow users to search any existing element found on
    [RPLANET](https://rplanet.io/all_elements) and see the cost of that element from **AETHER** > **WAX** > **USD**
<img src="assets/images/readme/elements.png" alt="mining power" width="500" height="175"/>

## Features Left to Implement
* **WAX Sign-in**
    * Allows users to login directly to their WAX account to pull their data automatically
* **Tool Automation**
    * Retrieve data from user account and base tool algorithms on user data

# Testing

### Feature testing

| Test | Title | Process | Result | 
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------- | 
| T1 | Splash screen | To test the splash screen was working correctly I ensured firstly that it responded well to all devices (mobile/tablet/desktop). I then tested the exit button to make sure it takes the user to the homepage | Working as expected |
| T2 | Live API data | To test the live API data was working correctly I monitored the change. This is expected to update every 10 seconds which it does and is working as expected  |  <img src="assets/images/readme/testing/Testresult1.png" alt="mining power" width="100" height="75"/>  |
| T3 | Live API data (Error/offline) | To test the Live API data I purposely disconnected the api calls to see the result. In this case it will display "Offline" in the live price section to let the user know the servers are down and the tool cannot be used  for this period of time| <img src="assets/images/readme/testing/Testresult3.png" alt="mining power" width="100" height="75"/> |
| T4 | Tool selection buttons | To test the tool selectors I switched between both tools multiples times to see if it would cause it to break which it did not, therefor is working as expected | <img src="assets/images/readme/testing/Testresult2.png" alt="mining power" width="100" height="45"/> |
| T5 | Tool 1 - Mining power | To test the mining power tool i inputted various data types into the input field. If a letter is inputted into the field the results return nothing as expected, if a special character is inputted into the field the results return nothing as expected | <img src="assets/images/readme/testing/Testresult4.png" alt="mining power" width="150" height="50"/>
| T6 | Tool 2 - Elements | To test this tool I attempted to search for an element, in this case the search input works if the | <img src="assets/images/readme/testing/Testresult4.png" alt="mining power" width="150" height="50"/> |
| T10 | Responsive design |  |  |
